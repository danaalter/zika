<h1>What's being done to stop Zika?</h1>
<img class="rotate" src="http://servsquad.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/HiRes.jpg">
<p>Health officials are implementing traditional mosquito control techniques such as spraying pesticides and emptying standing water receptacles where mosquitoes breed. The CDC encourages homeowners, hotel owners and visitors to countries with Zika outbreaks also to eliminate any standing water they see, such as in outdoor buckets and flowerpots. 

<br>Another prevention effort is OX513A, a genetically modified male Aedes aegypti, dubbed by critics as the "mutant mosquito". It is designed to stop the spread of Zika by passing along a mutated gene that makes his offspring die. Since females only mate once, in theory this slows the growth of the population.

Key West, Florida, residents gave the genetically modified male his monster nicknames while protesting a trial release of the mosquito in 2012 as a way to combat an outbreak of dengue fever in South Florida. The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing that effort.
