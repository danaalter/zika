<h1 data-headline>What is Zika, and why is it so serious?</h1>
<p>The Zika virus is a flavivirus, and is part of the same family as yellow fever and West Nile. BUT, unlike some of those viruses, there is NO vaccine to prevent Zika, or any known medicine to treat the infection. Zika is commanding attention because of an alarming connection between the virus and microcephaly, a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. It causes severe developmental issues and sometimes death. <br> In most people, symptoms of the virus are mild, including fever, headache, rash and possible pink eye. In fact, 80% of those infected never know they have the disease.</p>

<!--<h3>2. How is Zika spread?</h3>
<p>The virus is most commonly transmitted when an Aedes mosquito bites a person with an active infection and then spreads the virus by biting others. Those people become carriers when they have symptoms.
<br> And, it's now being sexually transmitted.</p>

<h3>3. Where is the Zika virus now?</h3>
<p> Everywhere. It's everywhere. The Zika virus is now being locally transmitted in Aruba, Barbados, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Marshall Islands, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Saint Martin, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, U.S. Virgin Islands, Venezuela, American Samoa, Samoa, Tonga and Cape Verde, according to the CDC and WHO.
Zika has arrived in the United States from travelers returning from these infected areas and, in one confirmed case and 14 suspected cases, through sexual transmission. Don't leave your house. 

<h3>4. What can you do to protect yourself from Zika?</h3> 
<p>With no treatment or vaccine available, the only protection against Zika is to avoid travel to areas with an active infestation. If you do travel to a country where Zika is present, the CDC advises strict adherence to mosquito protection measures: Use an EPA-approved repellent over sunscreen, wear long pants and long-sleeve shirts thick enough to block a mosquito bite, and sleep in air-conditioned, screened rooms.

<h3>5. What's being done to stop Zika?</h3>
<p>Health officials are implementing traditional mosquito control techniques such as spraying pesticides and emptying standing water receptacles where mosquitoes breed. The CDC encourages homeowners, hotel owners and visitors to countries with Zika outbreaks also to eliminate any standing water they see, such as in outdoor buckets and flowerpots. 
<br>Another prevention effort is OX513A, a genetically modified male Aedes aegypti, dubbed by critics as the "mutant mosquito" or "Robo-Frankenstein mosquito." The creation of British company Oxitec, OX513A is designed to stop the spread of Zika by passing along a gene that makes his offspring die. Since females only mate once, in theory this slows the growth of the population. Each OX513A carries a fluorescent marker, so scientists can track him.
Key West, Florida, residents gave the genetically modified male his monster nicknames while protesting a trial release of the mosquito in 2012 as a way to combat an outbreak of dengue fever in South Florida. The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing that effort.
